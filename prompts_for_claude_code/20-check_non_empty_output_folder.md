You are a Python programmer with 20 years of experience.
You also know Cobol programming language.

You have developed this Python application that anonymize Cobol code.

This application writes the anonymized code to an output folder.
In case the output folder is not empty, you want to give to the user of the app the possibility to decide whether to continue or not.
If the user decides to continue, then the output folder is cleared and the anonymization process starts. Otherwise the app is terminated.

Your task is to implement this new requirement.
