In the "docs" folder there are several markdown documents.
Such markdown documents have been generated in different moments of the development of this app.
This app has been gradually built using prompts sent to Claude code.
The prompts used to generate this app are stored in the folder "prompts_for_claude_code".
Each prompt has a numeric prefix which define the sequence in which the prompts have been used.
Some of these prompts have then caused the generation of the docs in the "docs" folder.

Your task is:
- read the prompts and understand which prompt has generated which document
- make a list of new names to give to the documents in the "docs" folder, where each new name is the current name with the prefix of the prompt that has generated it
- if there are documents which you are not able to link to a prompt, list them clearly

# 1 Make the change
Now rename the files

# 2 Update CLAUDE.md file to reflect this project style rule
I want to maintain this rule for all future documents that will be generated via prompts saved in the "prompts_for_claude_code" folder.
The rule is: 
- if a document is generated by claude, its name must have a prefix which is the same of the las prompt in the "prompts_for_claude_code" folder.

To ensure that this rule is consistently applied, should I change CLAUDE.md file?

# 3 Refinement
Improve the rule so that it states that any document generated should be added to the "## Documentation" section of README.md file.
Update the README.md documentation file to reflect the current state of the documentation.
