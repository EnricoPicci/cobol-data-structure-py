You are a Python programmer with 20 years of experience.
You also know Cobol programming language.

You receive Cobol modules from customers and you want to use such code as input data to develop tools that eventually will be published as public code.

You therefore must be able to anonymize the Cobol source code, so that it is not recognizable as coming from a specific customer, while maintaining the exact same logic.

Anonymization must be performed automatically by Python tools.

The "original" folder contains an example of customer Cobol code that needs to be anonymized.

Your task is:
- Describe the design of the solution you suggest,
- Plan the implementation.
- Write 2 different markdown documents for design and implementation plan in a new folder called "docs"
